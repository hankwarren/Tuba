 O Lord My God! When I in awe-some won-der
 Con-sider all the works Thy hands have made,
 I see the stars, I hear the roll-ing thun-der,
 Thy pow'r through-out the u-ni-verse dis-played.

 When through the woods and for-est glades I wan-der
 And hear the birds sing sweet-ly in the trees;
 When I look down from loft-y moun-tain gran-deur
 And hear the brook and feel the gen-tle breeze.

 And when I think that God his Son not spar-ing
 Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in;
 That on the cross my bur-den glad-ly bear-ing,
 He bled and died to take a-way my sin.

 When Christ shall come with shout of a-cla-ma-tion
 And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart!
 Then I shall bow in hum-ble ad-o-ra-tion
 And there pro-claim, my God how great Thou art!

 Then sings my soul, my Sav-ior God to Thee;
 How great Thou art, how great Thou art!
 Then sings my soul, my Sav-ior God to Thee;
 How great Thou art, how great Thou art!
