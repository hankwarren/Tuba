There are thing as we trav-el this earth's shift-ing sands,
That trans-cend all the rea-son of man;
But the things that mat-ter the most in this world,
They can nev-er be held in our hand.

I be-lieve that the Christ who was slain on the cross,
Has the pow-er to change lives to-day;
For He changed me com-plet-ly, a new life is mine;
That is why by the cross I will stay.

I be-lieve that this life with its great mys-ter-ies,
Sure-ly some-day will come to an end;
But faith will con-quer the dark-ness and death
and will lead me at last to my friend.

I be-lieve in a hill called Mount Cal-v'ry
I'll be-lieve what-e-ver the cost;
And when time has sur-rend-ered and earth is no more,
I'll still cling to that old rug-ged cross.
