There is not a moth-er,
sis-ter, friend or broth-er
loves the way that Je-sus can.
He proved His love for me
when He died on Cal-va-ry;
He gave His life for fall-en man.

His love, is a bound-less love
and it reach-es down and touch-es me;
His love, is an end-less love,
that will last thro' all e-ter-ni-ty.

His love, His love, is a bound-less love
and it reach-es down and touch-es me;
His love, His love, is an end-less love,
that will last thro' all e-ter-ni-ty.

His love, His love, is a bound-less love
and it reach-es down and touch-es me, touch-es me;
His love, His love, is an end-less love,
that will last thro' all e-ter-ni-ty.

Je-sus wants to love you;
there is none a-bove you
You are prec-ious in His sight.
He will nev-er fail you
when the doubts as-sail you
He'll be with you day and night
