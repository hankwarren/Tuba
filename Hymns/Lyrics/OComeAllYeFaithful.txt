O come, all ye faith-ful, joy-ful and tri-um-phant,
O come ye, O come ye to Beth-le-hem!
Come and be-hold Him, born the King of an-gels!

Sing choirs of an-gels, sing in ex-ul-ta-tion,
O sing, all ye bright hosts of heav'n a-bove!
Glo-ry to God, all glo-ry in the high-est!

Yea, Lord we greet Thee, born this hap-py morn-ing,
Je-sus, to Thee be all glo-ry giv'n;
Word of the Fath-er, now in flesh ap-pear-ing!

O come, let us a-dore Him, O come, let us a-dore Him,
O come, let us a-dore Him, Christ the Lord!
