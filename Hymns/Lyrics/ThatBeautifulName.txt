I know of a name, a beau-ti-ful name,
That an-gels bro't down to earth;
They whis-pered it low, One night long a-go,
To a maid-en of low-ly birth.

I know of a name, a beau-ti-ful name,
That un-to a Babe was giv-en;
The stars glit-tered bright, Thro'-out that glad night
And an-gels praised God in heav'n.

The One of that name, My Sav-ior be-came
My Sav-ior of Cal-va-ry;
My sin nailed him there, My bur-den to bear,
He suf-fered all this for me.

I love that blest name, That won-der-ful name,
Made high-er than all in heav-en;
'Twas whis-pered, I know, in my heart long a-go,
To Je-sus my life I've given.

That beau-ti-ful name, that beau-ti-ful name
From sin has power to free us?
That beau-ti-ful name, that won-der-ful name,
That match-less name is Je-sus!
