Shout to the Lord, all the earth, let us sing
pow-er and maj-es-ty, praise to the King;
Moun-tains bow down and the seas will roar at the sound of Your name
I sing for joy at the work of Your hands,
for-ev-er I'll love You, for-ev-er I'll stand;
Noth-ing com-pares to the prom-ise I have in You.
My Je-sus, my Sav-ior, Lord, there is none like You,
all of my days Iwant to praise the won-ders of Your might-y love;
My Com-fort, my Sav-ior, Tow-er of ref-uge and strength;
Let ev-'ry breath, all that I am, nev-er cease to wor-ship You.

Noth-ing com-pares to the prom-ise I have in You.
