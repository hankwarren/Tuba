Great is Thy faith-ful-ness, O God my Fa-ther,
There is no shad-ow of turn-ing with Thee.
Thou change-est not, Thy com-pas-sions they fail not;
As Thou hast been Thou for-ev-er willt be.

Sum-mer and win-ter and spring-time and har-vest,
Sun, moon and stars in their cours-es a-bove;
Join with all nat-ure in man-i-fold wit-ness
To Thy great faith-ful-ness, mer-cy and love.

Par-don for sin and a peace that en-dur-eth,
Thy own dear pres-ence to cheer and to guide;
Strength for to-day and bright hope for to-mor-row,
Bless-ings all mine, with ten thou-sand be-side!

Great is Thy faith-ful-ness! Great is Thy faith-ful-ness!
Morn-ing by morn-ing new mer-cies I see;
All I have need-ed Thy hand hath pro-vid-ed
Great is Thy faith-ful-ness, Lord un-to me!
