Would you be free from the bur-den of sin?
There's pow'r in the blood, pow'r in the blood;
Would you o'er e-vil a vec-to-ry win?
There's won-der-ful pow'r in the blood.

Would you be free from your pas-sion and pride?
There's pow'r in the blood, pow'r in the blood;
Come for a cleans-ing to Cal-va-ry's tide?
There's won-der-ful pow'r in the blood.

Would you be whit-er, much whit-er than snow?
There's pow'r in the blood, pow'r in the blood;
Sin-stains are lost in its life-giv-ing flow;
There's won-der-ful pow'r in the blood.

Would you do serv-ice for Je-sus your King?
There's pow'r in the blood, pow'r in the blood;
Would you live dai-ly His prais-es to sing?
There's won-der-ful pow'r in the blood.

There is pow'r, pow'r, won-der work-ing pow'r
In the blood of the Lamb;
There is pow'r, pow'r, won-der work-ing pow'r
In the pre-cious blood of the Lamb.
