Im-mor-tal, in-vis-i-ble, God on-ly wise,
In light in-ac-ces-si-ble, hid from our eyes,
Most bless-ed, most glor-ious, the An-cient of Days,
Al-might-y, vic-to-rious, Thy great name we praise.

Un-rest-ing, un-hast-ing, and si-lent as light,
Nor want-ing, nor wast-ing, Thou rul-est in might;
Thy jus-tice like moun-tains high soar-ing a-bove,
Thy clouds which are foun-tains of good-ness and love.

To all, life Thou giv-est, to both great and small;
In all life Thou liv-est, the true life of all;
We blos-som and flour-ish as leaves on the tree,
And with-er and per-ish, but aught chang-eth Thee.

Great Fa-ther of glo-ry, pure Fa-ther of light,
Thine an-gels a-dore Thee, all veil-ing their sight;
All praise we would ren-der, O help us to see,
'Tis on-ly the splen-dor of light hid-eth Thee.
