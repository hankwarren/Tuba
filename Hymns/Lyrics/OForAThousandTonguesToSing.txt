O for a thou-sand tongues to sing,
My great re-deem-er's praise,
The glo-ries of my God and King,
The tri-umphs of His grace.

Je-sus! the name that charms our fears,
That bids our sor-rows cease,
'Tis mus-ic in the sin-ner's ears,
'Tis life and health and peace.

He breaks the power of can-celed sin,
He sets the pris-oner free,
His blood can make the foul-est clean,
His blood a-vailed for me.

Hear Him, ye deaf! His praise ye dumb,
Your loos-ened tongues em-ploy;
Ye blind, be-hold your Sav-ior come,
And leap, ye lame, for joy

My grac-ious Mas-ter and my God,
As-sist me to pro-claim,
To spread thro' all the earth a-broad,
The hon-ors of Thy name.
