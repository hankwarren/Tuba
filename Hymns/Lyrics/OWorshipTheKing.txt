 O wor-ship the King, all glo-rious a-bove,
 And grate-ful-ly sing His won-der-ful love;
 Our Shield and De-fend-er, the An-cient of Days,
 Pa-vil-ioned in splen-dor, and gird-ed with praise.

 O tell of His might, O sing of His grace,
 Whose robe is the light, whose ca-no-py space!
 His char-iots of wrath the deep thun-der clouds form,
 And dark is His path on the wings of the storm.

 Thy boun-ti-ful care what tongue can re-cite?
 It breaths in the air, it shines in the light,
 It streams from the hills, it de-scends to the plain,
 And sweet-ly dis-tills in the dew and the rain.

 Frail child-ren of dust and fee-ble as frail,
 In Thee do we trust, nor find Thee to fail:
 Thy mer-cies how tend-er, how firm to the end,
 Our Mak-er, De-fend-er, Re-deem-er and Friend.
