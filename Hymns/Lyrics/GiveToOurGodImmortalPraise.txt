Give to our God im-mor-tal praise!
Mer-cy and truth are all His ways;
Al-le-lu-ia! Al-le-lu-ia!
Won-ders of grace to God be-long,
Re-peat His mer-cies in your song.

Give to the Lord of lords re-nown,
The King of kings with glo-ry crown;
Al-le-lu-ia! Al-le-lu-ia!
His mer-cies ev-er shall en-dure,
When lords and kings are known no more.

He saw the Gen-tiles dead in sin,
And felt his pi-ty work with-in;
Al-le-lu-ia! Al-le-lu-ia!
His mer-cies ev-er shall en-dure,
When death and sin shall reign no more.

He sent His son with p'wer to save,
From guilt, and dark-ness, and the grave;
Al-le-lu-ia! Al-le-lu-ia!
Won-ders of grace to God be-long,
Re-peat His mer-cies in your song.

Al-le-lu-ia!
Al-le-lu-ia!
Al-le-lu-ia!
Al-le-lu-ia!
Al-le-lu-ia!
