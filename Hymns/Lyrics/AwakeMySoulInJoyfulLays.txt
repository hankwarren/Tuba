A-wake, my soul in joy-ful lays,
And sing Thy great re-deem-er's praise;
He just-ly claims a song from me,
His lov-ing-kind-ness, oh how free!
Lov-ing-kind-ness, lov-ing-kind-ness,
His lov-ing-kind-ness, oh, how free!

He saw me ru-ined by the fall,
Yet loved me not with-stand-ing all;
He saved me from my lost es-tate,
His lov-ing-kind-ness, oh how great!
Lov-ing-kind-ness, lov-ing-kind-ness,
His lov-ing-kind-ness, oh, how great!

Tho' num'-rous hosts of might-y foes,
Tho' earth and hell my way op-pose,
He safe-ly leads my soul a-long,
His lov-ing-kind-ness, oh how strong!
Lov-ing-kind-ness, lov-ing-kind-ness,
His lov-ing-kind-ness, oh, how strong!

When trou-ble, like a gloom-y cloud,
Has gath-ered thick and thund-ered loud,
He near my soul has al-ways stood,
His lov-ing-kind-ness, oh how good!
Lov-ing-kind-ness, lov-ing-kind-ness,
His lov-ing-kind-ness, oh, how good!

Soon shall we mount and soar a-way
To the bright realms of end-less day,
And sing, with rap-ture and sur-prise,
His lov-ing-kind-ness, in the skies.
Lov-ing-kind-ness, lov-ing-kind-ness,
His lov-ing-kind-ness, in the skies.
