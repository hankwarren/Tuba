His name is Won-der-ful,
His name is Won-der-ful,
His name is Won-der-ful,
Je-sus my Lord.
He is the might-y King,
Mas-ter of ev-ery-thing,
His name is Won-der-ful,
Je-sus my Lord.
He's the great Shep-herd,
The Rock of all a-ges,
Al-might-y God is He.
Bow down be-fore Him,
Love and a-dore Him,
His name is Won-der-ful,
Je-sus my Lord.
