I tried to find life's mys-ter-ies,
Just by the rea-son of my mind to see,
But void re-mained 'tween me and where I longed to be,
'Til child-like faith there built a bridge for me.

I thought I had to see and feel,
To prove that what I loved was real-ly real,
But pas-sion turned to ash-es, things I held to dust,
I found re-al-i-ty in sim-ple trust.

And O what joy to walk this way!
I fol-low nail-pierced foot prints all the way,
And though the end of where I'm bound I may not see,
I choose to place my trust in Cal-va-ry.

My faith still holds on to the Christ of Cal-va-ry,
O bless-ed Rock of A-ges cleft for me.
I glad-ly place my trust in things I can-not see,
My faith still holds on to the Christ of Cal-va-ry.
