He giv-eth more grace when the bur-dens grow great-er;
He giv-eth more strength when the la-bors in-crease.
To add-ed af-flic-tion He add-eth His mer-cy
To mul-ti-plied tri-als, His mul-ti-plied peace.

When we have ex-haust-ed our store of en-dur-ance,
When our strength has failed ere the day is half done,
When we reach the end of our hoard-ed re-sour-ces,
Our Fa-ther's full giv-ing is on-ly be-gun.

His love has no lim-it, His grace has no meas-ure,
His p'wer has no boun-da-ry known un-to men,
For out of His in-fi-nite rich-es in Je-sus,
He giv-eth, and giv-eth, and giv-eth a-gain!
