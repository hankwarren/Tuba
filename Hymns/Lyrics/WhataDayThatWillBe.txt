There is com-ing a day when no heart-aches shal come,
No more clouds in the sky, no more tears to dim the eye;
All is peace for ev-er-more on that hap-py gold-en shore
What a day, glo-ri-ous day, that will be.

There'll be no sor-row there, no more bur-dens to bear,
No more sick-ness no pain, no more part-ing o-ver there;
And for-ev-er I will be with the One who died for me
What a day, glo-ri-ous day, that will be.

What a day that will be when my Je-sus I shall see,
And I look up-on His face, the One who saved me by His grace;
When He takes me by the hand, and leads me through the Prom-ised Land,
What a day, glo-ri-ous day, that will be.
