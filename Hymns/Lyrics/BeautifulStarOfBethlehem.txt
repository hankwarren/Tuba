Oh Beau-ti-ful Star of Beth-le-hem
Shin-ing a-far thru shad-ows dim,
Giv-ing a light for those who long have gone;
And guid-ing the wise men on their way
Un-to the place where Je-sus lay,
Beau-ti-ful Star of Beth-le-hem shine on.

Oh Beau-ti-ful Star the hope of light,
Guid-ing the pil-grim thru the night
Over the moun-tains til the break of dawn,
And in-to the light of per-fect day,
It will give out a love-ly ray,
Beau-ti-ful Star of Beth-le-hem shine on.

Oh Beau-ti-ful Star the hope of rest,
For the re-deem-ed, the good and blest,
Yon-der in glo-ry when the crown is won;
For Je-sus is now the star di-vine,
Bright-er and bright-er He will shine,
Beau-ti-ful Star of Beth-le-hem shine on.

Oh Beau-ti-ful Star of Beth-le-hem,
Shine up-on us un-til the glo-ry dawn;
Oh give us they light to light the way
In-to the land of perfect day.
Beau-ti-ful Star of Beth-le-hem shine on.
