Some glad morn-ing when this life is o'er;
I'll fly away
To a home on God's ce-les-tial shore,
I'll fly away.

When the shad-ows of this life have gone,
I'll fly a-way
Like a bird from pris-on bars has flown,
I'll fly a-way.

Just a few more wea-ry days and then,
I'll fly a-way.
To a land where joys shall nev-er end.
I'll fly a-way.

fly a-way
fly a-way
fly a-way
fly a-way

I'll fly a-way, O glo-ry; I'll fly a-way
When I die, hal-le-lu-jah by and by,
I'll fly a-way.

fly a-way
fly a-way
in the morn-ing
fly a-way
fly a-way.
