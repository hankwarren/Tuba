O God, our help in ag-es past,
Our hope for yeas to come,
Our shel-ter from the storm-y blast,
And our e-ter-nal home!

Un-der the shad-ow of Thy throne,
Thy saints have dwelt se-cure;
Suf-fi-cient is Thine arm a-lone,
And our de-fense is sure.

Be-fore the hills in or-der stood,
Or earth re-ceived her frame,
From ev-er-last-ing Thou art God,
To end-less years the same.

A thou-sand a-ges in Thy sight,
Are like an eve-ning gone;
Short as the watch that ends the night,
Be-fore the ris-ing sun.

O God, our help in a-ges past,
Our hope for years to come,
Be Thou our guide while life shall last,
And our e-ter-nal home!
