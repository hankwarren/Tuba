To God be the glo-ry, great things He hath done,
So loved He this world that He gave us His Son,
Who yield-ed His life an a-tone-ment for sin,
And o-pened the life gates that all may go in.

O per-fect re-demp-tion, the pur-chase of blood,
To ev-'ry be-liev-er the prom-ise of God,
The vil-est of-fen-der who tru-ly be-lieves,
That mo-ment from Je-sus a par-don re-ceives.

Great things He hath taught us, great things He hath done,
And great our re-joic-ing thro' Je-sus the Son,
But pur-er and high-er and great-er will be
Our won-der, our trans-port when Je-sus we see.

Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
Let the earth hear His voice!
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
Let the peo-ple re-joice!
O come to the Fath-er thro' Je-sus the Son,
And give Him the glor-y great things He hath done.
